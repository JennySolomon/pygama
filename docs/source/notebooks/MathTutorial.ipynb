    "#### An aside on the ordering of parameters: \n",
    "In the following the term \"shape parameter\" refers to a specific variable used to define a distribution that is not an overall scaling (which I call $\\mu$) or shifting (which I call $\\sigma$). An example of shape parameters would be the $\\beta, m$ parameters in a crystal ball function. The location and scale ($\\mu, \\sigma$) parameters have a more specific definition --- akin to what `scipy` does. If a $\\mu, \\sigma$ value is present, then the entire distribution is shifted and scaled; this can be achieved by transforming $y = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$ and computing $pdf(y)/\\sigma$ ( where the factor of $1/\\sigma$ comes from the Jacobian). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ordering of parameters is as follows, using whichever are needed for a function: \n",
    "`x, area, x_lower, x_upper, shapes, ..., mu, sigma`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `x_lower` and `x_upper` are the lower and upper bounds to evaluate a function on. These are particularly important when the support of a function depends on its fit range; distributions like uniform, linear, and step distributions are defined on a finite support and thus `x_lower` and `x_upper` are parameters that should be passed to *every* function call. \n",

If shape parameters are present, `nb_distribution_pdf` must also be called with `shape_param[0]` because `scipy` passes an array of shape parameters to the function calls. Finally, `x.flags.writeable = True` must be passed so that `numba` can operate as expected on arrays. \n",

    "\n",
    "`sum_dists` works by adding two --- and only two --- distributions together. The first thing a user does in creating a new instance is define the order of elements in a `parameter_array`. Then, `sum_dists` works by grabbing elements at different indices in this `parameter_array` according to rules that the user provides in the instantiation. Here's how to write a generic class: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `parameter_index_array` that holds the indices of what will eventually come in the `parameter_array`. If the user will eventually pass `parameters = [frac1, mu, sigma]` then we just take `parameter_index_array=[frac1, mu, sigma]=range(3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `sum_dists` takes an alternating pattern of distributions and distribution-specific parameter_index_arrays. Each par array can contain `[shape, mu, sigma]`. These par arrays are placed in a tuple with their distribution like `(dist1, [shape1, mu1, sigma1])`. Finally, a list of these tuples is fed to the constructor as `sum_dists([(dist1, [shape1, mu1, sigma1]), (dist2, [mu2, sigma2])])`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `sum_dists` constructor then takes an array corresponding the index locations of where either fraction or area values will be passed in the ultimate `parameter_index_array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We pass one of the 4 flag options, to be described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We can optionally pass a list of parameter names, but these can also be calculated automatically if left as None\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace through how the code works for a simple example. Suppose we want to create the following distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "$new\\_pdf(x, \\tau, \\mu, \\sigma, frac_1) = frac_1\\cdot dist_1(x, \\tau, \\mu, \\sigma) + (1-frac1)\\cdot dist_2(x, \\mu, \\sigma)$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So... What is `sum_dists` actually doing? \n",
    "Under the hood, `sum_dists` is applying a set of rules so that the following *is always* computed, regardless of the flag sent to the constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "`area1*frac1*dist1(x, shape, mu, sigma) + area2*frac2*dist_2(x, shape2, mu2, sigma2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "It computes this by first grabbing the relevant areas or fraction values from their position in the `parameter_index_array`. Then, at the time of method call, `sum_dists` grabs the values from `parameter_index_array` that correspond to each distribution via slicing the `parameter_index_array` with the individual par arrays passed in the instantiation. In our example above, `sum_dists` knows to grab the values at indices 0, 1, 2 for the first distribution because it is instantiated with the tuple `(dist1, [tau, mu, sigma])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also some work done to determine which of `area` and `frac` are present. That's the purpose of the `flag`. Let's take some time and learn a little more about what each flag does. \n",
